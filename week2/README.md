# 🟩 Week 2: Communication Tech – Wi-SUN, BLE, RAIL, S2LP

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Learn BLE (LE), Sub-GHz (S2LP), RAIL, Wi-SUN  
- Hands-on: Run BLE and Sub-GHz range tests on SiLabs platform

## 📘 Topics

- BLE vs BLE LE: Advertising, GATT, connection events  
- Sub-GHz RF concepts (S2LP), range, interference  
- Silicon Labs RAIL APIs: init, send, receive  
- Wi-SUN basics and stack setup on EFR32  
- Range Test app architecture (BLE and Sub-GHz)

## 🛠️ Deliverables

- BLE Range Test using Silicon Labs BLE stack  
- RAIL Sub-GHz test using S2LP or SiLabs  
- Wi-SUN Test Setup (node join, CLI ping)  
- Scripts to configure and evaluate range on BLE/Sub-GHz
