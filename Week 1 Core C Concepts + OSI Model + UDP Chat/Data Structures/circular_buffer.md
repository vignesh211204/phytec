## Circular Buffer

A **Circular Buffer** is a data structure that uses a **fixed-size array** as if it were connected end-to-end.

- It wraps around when the end of the array is reached.
- It‚Äôs super-efficient for **producer-consumer** scenarios and real-time systems like **audio processing**, **data streams**, and **network buffers**.

## üß† Core Operations

- **enqueue(x)** ‚Üí Add an element to the rear
- **dequeue()** ‚Üí Remove an element from the front
- **display()** ‚Üí Print the current buffer content

Also includes:
- `isFull()` ‚Üí Check if buffer is full
- `isEmpty()` ‚Üí Check if buffer is empty

## ‚öôÔ∏è Program Workflow

### 1. Enqueue (Insertion)

- When `enqueue(value)` is called:
  - It first checks if the buffer is **full** using the condition:
    ```c
    front == (rear + 1) % SIZE
    ```
    If true, insertion is denied with a message.
  - If the buffer is **empty** (`front == -1`), both `front` and `rear` are initialized to `0`.
  - Otherwise, the `rear` index is advanced in a circular way:
    ```c
    rear = (rear + 1) % SIZE;
    ```
  - The value is then stored in `buffer[rear]`.

### 2. Dequeue (Removal)

- `dequeue()` removes the element at the `front` index:
  - **Case 1: Empty Buffer**
    - If `front == -1`, it prints:
      ```
      Buffer is empty! Nothing to dequeue.
      ```
  - **Case 2: Single Element**
    - If `front == rear`, the buffer becomes empty after removal. Both are reset:
      ```c
      front = rear = -1;
      ```
  - **Case 3: Multiple Elements**
    - `front` is moved forward using:
      ```c
      front = (front + 1) % SIZE;
      ```

### 3. Display

- `display()` prints the buffer contents from `front` to `rear` in a circular fashion:
  - It uses a loop starting from `front`, printing each `buffer[i]`.
  - The index is incremented with:
    ```c
    i = (i + 1) % SIZE;
    ```
  - Loop ends when it reaches `rear`.
