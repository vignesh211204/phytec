# Threads and Multithreading in C

## üöÄ What is a Thread?
A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process.
Multiple threads in a single process run **concurrently** and **share memory**, making inter-thread communication easy.

## ‚úÖComparison: Thread vs Process

| Feature                | **Process**                                               | **Thread**                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Memory**             | Separate                                                  | Shared(Within same process)|
| **Communication**      | Complex(IPC required)                                     | Easy (shared memory)       |
| **Creation Time**      | Slow                                                      | Fast                       |
| **Crash Impact**       | Does not affect other process even if one is crashed also |  Can affect entire process |

### üéØ Why Use Threads? 
- Run multiple tasks simultaneously.  
- Perform background operations (e.g., data logging, sensor polling). 
- Improve performance on multi-core processors. 
- Keep software modular and responsive.

## What is Multithreading?
Multithreading is the ability of a program to **run multiple threads** in **parallel or concurrently**.

**Types**  
- **Preemptive** ‚Äì the operating system or RTOS scheduler automatically controls thread switching.  
- **Cooperative** ‚Äì the thread itself must voluntarily give up control (or yield) so another thread can run.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Thread Lifecycle in C

### ‚úÖ 1. Thread Creation
   `pthread_create()` ‚Äî create a new thread
### ‚úÖ2. Thread Termination
   Return from function or use `pthread_exit()`
### ‚úÖ3. Thread Join
   `pthread_join()` ‚Äî wait for thread to complete

## Thread Synchronization
Thread synchronization is the technique used to ensure that **multiple threads** can **safely access** and **modify** shared resources (like variables, memory, or devices) without interfering with each others).

**Thread Synchronization Mechanisms**  
- Mutex
- Semaphores
- Condition Variables
---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Mutexes (Mutual Exclusion Locks)
-  Its main purpose is to prevent multiple threads from accessing a critical section ‚Äî a part of code that accesses shared data ‚Äî at the same time.
-  When a thread reaches a critical section, it locks the mutex using `pthread_mutex_lock()`.
-  If another thread tries to lock the same mutex, it will wait (block) until the first thread unlocks it using `pthread_mutex_unlock()`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Semaphores
- It can control access to a shared resource by maintaining a counter, which represents how many threads can access the resource at the same time.
- Threads decrease the counter using `sem_wait()` (also called P operation), and increase it with `sem_post()` (also called V operation).
- If the counter is 0, `sem_wait()` blocks the thread until the counter increases.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Condition Variables
- A condition variable allows threads to wait (sleep) until a particular condition is met, and then be signaled to continue.
- They are always used with a mutex, and help when threads need to wait for a change in program state that another thread will cause.
- The producer signals the condition using `pthread_cond_signal()` or `pthread_cond_broadcast()` after adding data.
- The consumer waits using `pthread_cond_wait()` ‚Äî which internally unlocks the mutex and puts the thread to sleep.

## üß† What is a Scheduler?
In a system where multiple tasks or threads are active, the scheduler is like a controller ‚Äî it ensures that each thread/task gets a fair chance to execute, based on rules like priority, time slices, or task state.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è Role of a Scheduler
- Manages Task Execution
- Decides Which Task Runs Next
- Handles Task Priority
- Switches Context Between Tasks
- Optimizes CPU Utilization
---
## Task States

| **Task State**     | **Description**                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ready**          | Task is ready to run,waiting in queue                  |
| **Running**        | Task is currently using the CPU                        |
| **Blocked**        | Waiting for an event (I/O, timer, etc.)                |
| **Suspended**      | Manually paused, not eligible to run                   |

### üß© Types of Scheduling Algorithms
## ‚è≥ 1. Round Robin Scheduling

Round Robin is one of the simplest and most common scheduling algorithms. In this method, each task is assigned a fixed time slot (called a time quantum) during which it can use the CPU. After that time expires, the CPU is given to the next task in the queue, and this cycle continues endlessly.
## üß† Key Features:
- All tasks are treated equally, regardless of their urgency.
- It is non-preemptive within its time slice, but preemptive across slices
- Easy to implement but may not be suitable for real-time systems.

---
## üõë 2. Preemptive Priority Scheduling

In preemptive priority scheduling, each task is assigned a priority number. The scheduler always picks the task with the highest priority from the ready queue to run. If a lower-priority task is running and a higher-priority task becomes ready, the scheduler will immediately pause (preempt) the current task and switch to the higher-priority one.
## üß† Key Features:
- Tasks with higher priorities get more CPU time.
- Great for real-time and time-critical applications.
- Ensures responsiveness to critical events like interrupts, sensor alerts, or alarms.
