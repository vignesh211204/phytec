## üß†State Machine

A **state machine** is a programming pattern used to model system behavior as a sequence of defined **states** and **transitions**. It‚Äôs especially useful in embedded systems, communication protocols, and real-time applications.
A **state machine** consists of:
- **States**: Conditions or modes the system can be in.
- **Events**: Triggers that cause transitions between states.
- **Transitions**: Rules that define what happens when an event occurs in a given state.
- **Actions**: Operations performed during transitions or while in a state.

## üì® Use Case: Message Exchange Between Devices

### üìò States:
- **IDLE**: Waiting for a message
- **SENDING**: Sending a message
- **WAIT_ACK**: Waiting for acknowledgment
- **RECEIVING**: Receiving a message

### üì© Events:
- `send_request`
- `ack_received`
- `message_received`
- `timeout`

### üîÅ Transition Table

| Current State | Event           | Next State   | Action                    |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| IDLE          | send_request     | SENDING      | Prepare and send message  |
| SENDING       | message_sent     | WAIT_ACK     | Start timeout timer       |
| WAIT_ACK      | ack_received     | IDLE         | Confirm success           |
| WAIT_ACK      | timeout          | IDLE         | Retry or fail             |
| IDLE          | message_received | RECEIVING    | Process incoming message  |
| RECEIVING     | ack_sent         | IDLE         | Return to idle            |

## ‚úÖ Advantages of Event-Driven State Machines

- Clear and maintainable code structure  
- Scales well as complexity increases  
- Suitable for real-time, interrupt-driven systems  
- Easy debugging and simulation

|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **State**         | A mode the system is in (e.g., IDLE, SENDING)         |
| **Event**         | An input or trigger that causes a transition          |
| **Transition**    | Change from one state to another based on event       |
| **Action**        | Task executed during a state or transition            |
| **Event-Driven**  | System reacts only when an event occurs               |
| **Use Case**      | Message passing, protocol handling, device control    |
