# Week 1: Core C Concepts + OSI Model + UDP Chat

## Focus Areas

- OSI Model Understanding (with mapping to UDP)
- All foundational C brush-up topics
- Build a C-based UDP Chat App

## Topics

- OSI Layers: mapping to real protocols
- State Machine
- Events, Array, Pointers
- RTOS vs Superloop
- Scheduler, Threads
- Data Structures:
  - Queue
  - Linked List
  - Circular Buffer
- Pointers:
  - Structure pointers
  - Function pointers
  - Callback functions
- Bit operations & byte packing

## Deliverables

### Document

- Summary of OSI Model with protocol examples

### Code

- Basic Queue, Linked List, Circular Buffer implementations
- Event-driven state machine for message exchange
- UDP Chat App (Client-Server):
  - Send/Receive text
  - Uses command-line arguments
